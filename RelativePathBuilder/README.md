# Relative-Path-Builder
A Windows Application that builds a relative path from two given absolute paths

Enter paths in the two text boxes, and the Relative Path Builder will show you the relative path from path 1 to path 2 and path 2 to 1.
With (optional) command line parameters, you can provide one or both paths at startup

When integrating into Microsoft Visual Studio as an External Tool, you can use "$(ProjectDir)" as a command line parameter.
