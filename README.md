# Relative-Path-Builder
A Windows Application that builds a relative path from two given absolute paths

Enter paths in the two text boxes, and the Relative Path Builder will show you the relative path from path 1 to path 2 and path 2 to 1.
With (optional) command line parameters, you can provide one or both paths at startup

When integrating into Microsoft Visual Studio as an External Tool, you can use "$(ProjectDir)" as a command line parameter.

How to build:
Written in C#, build with Visual Studio 2017

How to install:
Just copy RelativePathBuilder.exe and the RelativePathBuilder.exe.config somewhere, no installation required.
.Net Runtime 4.5 or newer required
